				<h2>Character Build Designs</h2>
					<div class="main">
						<p>The builds displayed in this page are strictly for the players intending on playing PvE (Player versus Enviornment) or co-op play.
						They are designed for players wanting to play solo or co-op focused on winning boss battles and defeating regular enemies. 
						Included will be builds created by other players. This is not an all inclusive list of all builds done in Dark Souls, but is a good 
						starting point for new beginning players.</p>
					</div>
				<h3>PvE Builds</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>Versatile PvE Build</dt>
							<dd>The Versatile PvE build was created by DMCbr. Its main stats are Strength and Vitality, due to the nature of using large weapons and armor sets. 
							This build focuses on being highly versatile due to its high values in defense, poise,
							attack and HP. It also has a variety of weapons that can be used for different situations. The build also includes healing, pyromancy,
							and other ranged spells. The armor and rings provide the overall best defense, stability, high poise, and HP and includes mid roll. 
							The main weapon set is good for exploration and combat, and the boss set is good for dealing massive damage and allows for extra healing.

						<dt>Demon Hunter</dt>

						<dt>Dragon Hero</dt>
							<dd>The Dragon Hero build was created by Kalibur. This build is designed to be a jack of all trades build. The main components are speed and range,
							but can quicly end fights given the opportunity. The downside is that it has some of a learning curve given it has very little armor, speed and dodging are the 
							primary concept with this build.
